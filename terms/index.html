        </div>

        <h3>4.1 Data Transmitted to Third-Party AI Services</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Recipients of Data</h3>
        <p>Your data is transmitted to third-party AI service providers that specialize in natural language processing, speech recognition, transcription, and language analysis. These providers process your data solely on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
